#Path of Spirits

quest_tea_near_the_spirits_event;You seem quite perplexed with the world outside our own, bordering on obsession.

# PLANTATION EVENTS

tea_build_plantation_1_start;Your time with the Tea Enthusiasts has been inspirational, and over the last few weeks, you've been mulling the idea of growing a tea-leaf garden of your own. Others have done it, so why not you? Mind abuzz with thoughts of hosting tea parties with homegrown blends, you start considering the cost of such an endeavour.;
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_1;Gardening books! New tools! Fertilisers! Every coin is worth it!;
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_2;I can get started on a modest budget.;
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_3;How hard can it be to buy some seeds and water some plants?;

tea_build_plantation_1_fail;Unfortunately, the tea bushes you planted did not take. Perhaps gardening is not your strong suite.;
tea_build_plantation_1_fail_option;Unfortunate.;

tea_build_plantation_1_finish;It may have started slow, but your tea garden is finally bearing fruit -- or rather, leaves. In celebration, you decide to christen your harvest by inviting over your friends for tea, in what will surely be the first of many such parties.;
tea_build_plantation_1_finish_option;Drink up, everyone!;

tea_build_plantation_2_start;You've spent quite a lot of time enjoying the tea-leaf garden you inherited, both in harvesting leaves, and handing out packets of seeds to friends who adore your tea. Lately, though, you can't help but feel the garden is a bit... small. Your ancestor was a master caretaker, and the bushes they planted are well bred... but everything is so confined! Surely, by spreading such strong seeds to nearby land, your estate will flourish with tea bushes.;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_gold;I'll hire some gardeners to make sure the new bushes are tended.;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_self;Time to get my hands dirty!;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_spirits;Perhaps I should add some sacred soil from the forest?;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_free;Let me just throw around some seeds, and see what happens.;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_bail;On second thought, the garden is a fine size.;

tea_build_plantation_2_fail;After several years of waiting, the tea bushes you cast seeds for never took root. Perhaps your ancestor knew better, and that's why they stuck with such a small garden.;
tea_build_plantation_2_fail_option;At least I still have the garden.;

tea_build_plantation_2_finish;Several years ago, you planted tea seeds around your land, hoping to expand a single garden to a near-jungle of tea leaves. Peaking out your window, you now overlook a resplendent grove, bustling with bushes, dotted with all sorts of hybrids growing among them. Truly, there is nowhere on your estate you can go where a tea bush isn't within reach.;
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_self;I think I'm getting the hang of this!;
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_spirits;What strange leaves! I wonder what the tea will taste like?;

tea_build_plantation_3_start_1;Some time ago, your family planted a tea-leaf garden on the estate, and after allowing those bushes to expand into the surrounding nature, ended up with a vibrant grove entangled everything nearby. Of course, this gift was part of your inheritance -- after so many generations of caretakers, the responsibility finally falls on you to maintain it.;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1_option;Perhaps there is more I can do?;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_2;Surveying the untamed wilds of leaves and vines, you begin to think of how else you might manage such a grove. Why stop at just tending and pruning? With a little organisation, this grove could be developed into a real farm, with a set harvest, and a knowledgeable staff overseeing it.;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_1;Find me the best farmers in the land, and I will pay handsomely!;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_self;I will plead my case to the townsfolk to help!;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_spirits;I will seek guidance from the Spirits, to form a plan!;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_2;I can pay some farmers modestly to handle this.;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_bail;This will be too expensive.;
tea_build_plantation_3_finish;You wipe the sweat from your brow as you head in, satisfied after a hard day's work in the field. What was once untamed and erratic is now a meticulously organised farm, with rows of bushes, and even set ground for crossbreeding new tea leaves. It wasn't easy, but because of your efforts, you were able to reign in the grove you were handed-down, and make the harvest even more bountiful.;
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_self;Just an honest day's work.;
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_spirits;Thank the Spirits for blessing my estate.;
tea_build_plantation_3_fail;Once again looking out upon your estate, you see your efforts to tame the wilds have been largely frivolous. You tried your best, but perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.;
tea_build_plantation_3_fail_option;Oh well, I can still enjoy the grove.;

tea_build_plantation_4_start_1;Your family's tea farm has become quite famous, boasting not only generations of caretakers, but generations of patrons. However, that popularity ends at your borders -- truthfully, as well tended as the farms are, their tea production simply isn't high enough to meet the demand outside your own lands. Puzzling over this problem, you lock yourself in your study.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1_option;Hmm..;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_2;Labouring into the night, you draw up plans for a grand plantation -- not just one, but tens or perhaps even hundreds of well-tended farms. You will drive production so high that every tea shop across the Four Nations will stock your familial blends. Such an endeavour will be massive, and thus your plan will have to be meticulous.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_1;No cost is too great.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_self;This will be our glory! This will be the plantation of the people!;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_spirits;I have sought the Spirits before, I shall do so again!;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_2;If I'm careful, I can do this on a budget.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_bail;I need more time to gather resources.;
tea_build_plantation_4_finish;After almost a decade of labour, your grand vision has been realised: from a humble garden, to a blossoming grove, to a well-kept farm, and now finally to this, a colossal plantation, the absolute apex of a generational love of tea and the desire to spread that passion. Perusing the newly-leafed fields, you think back to all the work your forefathers put in before you, and how all of this must have started with a single inspirational thought after a warm cup of tea. You also think forward, to your children, and their children, and all your descendants, who will always have this plantation as part of their lives, and will feel you and your ancestors love through it. What you've built here isn't just a handful of farms, it's a monument to your whole family, past and future, and by the Spirits, it is glorious!;
tea_build_plantation_4_finish_option;It is magnificent!;
tea_build_plantation_4_fail;It would seem that starting a tea plantation is much more difficult then it seems. Although there's no recouping the money you've sunk into this, you feel like any more investments would just be a waste of time.;
tea_build_plantation_4_fail_option;The farm is enough, I suppose.;

find_physician_meeting_bad_desc;"Yes, I always loved herbal tea. The root for it is cultivated right here". She gestures to a windowsill garden, with fat ginger-leaves spilling over the side. Although plentiful, you struggle to find the words to ask this old lady if you can have some. In the end, you part ways, going home empty-handed.;

find_physician_meeting_medium_desc;"Oh, certainly", she says, reaching into a planter and pulling out a fresh sample. "Here it is. Be gentle when you brew it. If the water is too hot, or you oversaturate the kettle, you'll end up with a bitter mess!". You laugh, and promise to be careful when you blend the tea yourself. The two of you catch up, and after a short amount of time, you decide to head home, quarry in-hand.;

When you arrive, you see your good friend, Mushie, a man well into his seventies, with his arm over the shoulder of a girl no older than twenty-five! "There you are!", he says proudly, "I'd like you to meet Lai Ti".;

guest_brings_date_start_option_low_diplomacy;Mushie, you lucky dog!;

guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_event;Mushie gives you an angry look. "Lai Ti is my granddaughter, not my date. For the Spirits' sake, I'm almost fifty years older than her!". The poor girl looks off to the side, embarrassed by your comment, and she and Mushie storm off.

guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_option;What an embarrassment.;
guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_option_tooltip;Your idiot friend is at fault!;

guest_brings_date_low_learning_event;Mushie is taken aback by your statement, and after a moment of uncomfortable silence, he introduces you to the girl who is, in fact, his granddaughter. Not knowing what to say, you stumble for words, and decide to simply avoid Mushie for the rest of the night.;
guest_brings_date_low_learning_option;This is awkward.;
guest_brings_date_low_learning_option_tooltip;It really is.;

guest_brings_date_high_diplomacy_event;Pleased at your response, Mushie smiles and says "Yes, this is Lai Ti, my granddaughter!

"Thank you for having us", she says, "you are a most gracious host!".;

Shoving his way inside, he moves over to the table, and adds his new biscuits to the batch.;

green_tea_served_bad_event;Although picked fresh, natural doesn't always mean 'the best', and this green tea is far, far too bitter for your liking. You can see your guests recoiling to the taste as well, but finishing anyway, to not be rude.;

green_tea_served_medium_event;Finishing your first cup, you find the green tea delightful. It's not much different than what you'd find in a shop, but it's more satisfying since you picked the leaves yourself.;

green_tea_served_good_event;You barely make it half way through your first cup before you see one of your guests reach for the kettle. "This is the best green tea I've ever had in my life! You must show me where you picked these leaves!". You give a satisfied grin, and promise to take him on your next exploration.;


white_dragon_tea_served_event;"Esteemed guests, today I have a very special treat for you! While exploring the forest, I came across a rare White Dragon tea bush. Picking its leaves, I have prepared a most delicious brew!". You hear a few small claps and gasps as an air of excitement fills the room. Grabbing the freshly brewed pot, you lean in and pour the first cup for a guest. Not hesistating a moment, he takes a sip, and...;
white_dragon_tea_served_option;......;
white_dragon_tea_served_option_tooltip;You brace for your guest's reaction.;

white_dragon_tea_served_bad_event;Disaster! The White Dragon leaves you picked were actually White Jade leaves! Your guest kneels over, covered in disgusting red blisters! He needs emergency help!;
white_dragon_tea_option_bad_bad;This party is over, we need to get him to the doctor!
white_dragon_tea_option_bad_bad_tooltip;Chaos ensues!;

white_dragon_tea_option_bad_good;The berries I picked! Quickly, give him some!;
white_dragon_tea_option_bad_good_tooltip;You may be able to save him yet!;

white_dragon_tea_served_bad_bad_followup_event;With no way to help your friend, the other guests grab him and rush him out the door. Your party has ended in catastrophe.;
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_bad_followup_option;This is a nightmare.;
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_bad_followup_option_tooltip;I've brought disgrace to this household!;

white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_event;Not hesitating for a moment, you grab Bacui berries, and feed them to your suffering friend. Within minutes, the rashes go down, and you see him begin to return to normal. However, your other guests still seem quite displeased at your near-fatal mistake.;
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_option;This could have been a nightmare.;
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_option_tooltip;You realise things could have been much worse.;

white_dragon_tea_served_good_event;"Delicious! Absolutely delicious! Brewed to perfection!", he elates, a smile stretching across his face. "To think we'd get to sample such a rare tea, and so fresh! This is the best tea party I've ever attended!";
white_dragon_tea_served_good_option;Thank you! Anything for my guests!;
white_dragon_tea_served_good_option_tooltip;You served a truly rare tea!;


jasmine_tea_served_event;"So for today, I decided to go with something classic. Something sweet. That's why I've brewed this fine jasmine tea for us to share". Your guests look at you pleased, taking comfort in the familiarity of the flavor. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the best way to go about.;
jasmine_tea_served_option;I hope everyone is thirsty.;
jasmine_tea_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of jasmine tea, and...;

jasmine_tea_served_bad_event;Taking a sip of the tea, you're met with an overwhelming sweetness, ruining the overall flavor. Perhaps the jasmine blossoms you used were no good?;

jasmine_tea_served_medium_event;The jasmine tea is as fine as any other, and as you pour cup after cup, you can hear the satisfied sips of your guests. Perhaps what everyone really needed was this -- a relaxing afternoon, with a well-loved blend.;

jasmine_tea_served_good_event;There's an art to brewing tea, and a balance in maintaining the flavor of the drink itself with the added sweetness of the jasmine blossoms. Knowing that, the brew you made today is nothing short of masterful -- an absolutely perfect blend of flavors. Despite being such a familiar tea, you feel refreshed after each sip, and feel proud on how something so common could be made so beautiful.;

ginger_root_served_with_special_guest_event;"Recently, I visited a very special family friend of mine, and found out, like me, she was a lover of tea. She generously gave me a sample of ginger root from her own garden, which I've used for today's brew." You gesture to the back of the room, "So everyone, please, say thank you to the woman who made today possible!". Everyone turns and softly claps, and you see your physician begin to blush.;

ginger_root_served_without_special_guest_event;"Recently, I visited a very special family friend of mine, and found out, like me, she was a lover of tea. She generously gave me a sample of ginger root from her own garden, which I've used for today's brew." You think of the woman sitting in her home, and part of you wishes she could be here to receive the praise she so rightly deserves.;
ginger_root_served_option;Good for the heart, and the soul!;
ginger_root_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of green tea, and...;

ginger_root_served_bad_event;It only occurs to you now that how intensely bitter this ginger tea is. Thinking back, you never asked for the actual recipe your physician used, just for the ginger root itself. Even your guests, trying to be polite, can't help but wince with each sip.;

ginger_root_served_medium_event;Although you wouldn't call it flavorless, it's clear that the ginger tea you have is medicinal. Still, your guests don't seem to mind -- most of them are elderly, and they can appreciate a blend good for the heart.;

ginger_root_served_good_event;What a unique flavor! Part of you believed the tea would be intensely bitter, but it is somehow bitter and... sweet? Whatever your physician gave you, it is her own creation, and you truly cannot think of another tea like this one. Your guests seem baffled, too, as you hear chatter flare up trying to solve the mysteries behind this wonderful blend.;

# post-tea evaluation

post_tea_bad_event;Instead of lively chat, your party is mostly murmurs. Your guests don't seem to have much to talk about, and are only taking small sips of the tea you've laid out for them. Perhaps the ingredients weren't as good as you hoped.;
post_tea_bad_option;Maybe they're just lost in thought?;
post_tea_bad_option_tooltip;For a party, it's unusually quiet...;

post_tea_medium_event;Lifting your kettle, you feel like your brew has almost run out. Your guests seem entertained, so you take a moment to sneak off back to the kitchen to make some more tea. Things are going well!;
post_tea_medium_option;My guests are having a good time!;
post_tea_medium_option_tooltip;You're having a very comfy day.;

post_tea_good_option_tooltip;Your guests will be talking about this party for quite some time.;

# pre-determined post-tea event

hot_spring_water_tea_event;One of your colleagues pulls you aside, to privately ask you a question. "I hate to be a bother, but what did you put in this tea? Aches and pains I've grown to know have vanished, and my knees feel like they did twenty years ago!". You smile wryly, knowing full well the hot spring water has worked its magic.;

hot_spring_water_tea_bad_option;Sorry, that's my secret to know.;
hot_spring_water_tea_bad_option_tooltip;You keep the magic of the hot spring a secret.;

hot_spring_water_tea_good_option;Sacred water, collected from a spiritual hot spring!;
hot_spring_water_tea_good_option_tooltip;You profess your enamoration of the holy spring you found.;


doctor_is_waterbender_event;"Here, let me show you the special way I mix the tea". Commanding a small audience, your physician grabs a handful of ginger root and a lukewarm kettle. Suddenly, from the spout, water pours upwards, dancing in the air. With masterful precision, she throws the ginger root in with one hand, whilst keeping the water afloat with the other.;

doctor_is_waterbender_culture_option;Of course, you must be a healer!;
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_option_tooltip;You realise your physician must be a master healer!;

doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_option;A mystic of the Northern Tribes!;
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_option_tooltip;You begin realising her health at her age makes sense, for a mystic such as herself!;

doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_option_tooltip;You are dumbstruck by this revelation!;

doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_event;"One of the oldest in our tribe, in fact!", she says, not missing a beat. The ginger root continues to swirl, making beautiful patterns, before pouring itself across several cups.;

doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_normal_option_tooltip;You're grateful your party has been attended by such a prestigious member of the tribe!;

doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_teach_option_tooltip;You learn the basics of healing from your old physician.;

doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_event;"I wouldn't call myself a mystic. Most girls are raised to heal, and I just happened to pick up a few other techniques along the way". The floating tea makes a few more dazzling swirls before dropping suddenly to the table, filling the cups of all those watching. "Truly, I've always thought of myself as more of a... teabender".;
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_option;Of course, the fifth element!;
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_option_tooltip;Your party has been blessed with such skill and entertainment!;

doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_event;Your physician winks at you. "Yes, in my younger days I travelled the world, touring the Nations, and healing all those in need along the way. When I found my youth spent, I settled down, and became a simple family doctor." The tea in the air continues to swish and swirl, and finally lands to fill several cups. "A technique I've perfected over the years. Go on, try some!".;
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_option;You're a teabender!;
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_option_tooltip;She may only know one element, but what an element it is!;


badger_plays_pai_sho_events;Strutting in from the kitchen, the Badger Spirit wanders into your tea room, to the surprise of your guests. Most seem to think it's just a pet, and some even scratch its head, of which it is oddly receptive. The weirdness only begins when the badger sits at your Pai Sho table, and abruptly lays out the pieces for a game.;

badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_option;Who among you can defeat my trained badger?;
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_option_tooltip;You're not sure where this is going, but you're interested to watch.;

badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_option;I will play the badger myself!;
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_option_tooltip;You'll probably be able to play it off as a joke, without anyone realising this is a spirit.;

badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_option;I'll play, but I must be wary of this spirit's knowledge.;
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_option_tooltip;Perhaps you can learn a thing or two from this creature?;

badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_event;"I'll take that bet!", one of your guests boasts. The room roars with laughter as he sets up his pieces, and the man joins in with them. However, after just a few moves, it is clear the badger is the superior player, and the man is easily defeated. "How? What? This badger?", he sputters in disbelief. "I... don't know how you've managed to train him, but this badger... is a beast!".;
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_option;He, uh, learned from the best.;
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_option_tooltip;Your guests are impressed with your fictitious animal-handling.;

badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_event;Sitting down at the Pai Sho table, you place your pieces on the board. As the game unfolds, however, you realise the situation is helpless. The Badger Spirit is impossibly skilled, and seems to anticipate your every move. The match is over quickly, and your guests clap and laugh, thinking the entire thing was a bit.;
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_option;I meant to do that!;
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_option_tooltip;You lost, but at least you learned something.;

badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_event;You sit down at the table, aware of what you're about to get into. Your guests laugh and clap, thinking this some elaborate joke, but you know better. Obviously there's no way to read your opponent, but it is a badger, but you can probably learn something from its moves. The game starts, and you realise quickly that this creature has perhaps centuries of Pai Sho knowledge under its furry pelt.;
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_option;It is impossible to win!;
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_option_tooltip;The Spirit's moves are impossible to counter!;


badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_event;The game is over quickly, and the applause from your guests has only grown louder. To them, this whole thing was a show.

badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_option;Well played, well played!;
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_option_tooltip;You lost, but you walk away with a greater understanding of the game.;

extra_guests_evaluation_event;So many more guests showed up than you expected, and as day wanes, you begin to hear whispers among the crowd.;
extra_guests_evaluation_tooltip;You listen to the whispers...;

extra_guests_evaluation_bad_option;Such nasty murmurs!;
extra_guests_evaluation_medium_option;It seems like a mixed bag...;
