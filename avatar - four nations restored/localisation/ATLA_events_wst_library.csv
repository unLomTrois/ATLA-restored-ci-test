EVTNAMEWSTLIBRARY.1;Wan Shi Tong's Library;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWSTLIBRARY.1;My search of the Si Wong Desert for lost knowledge has borne fruit, for today I have stumbled upon an ancient library. The library's guardian, knowledge spirit Wan Shi Tong, has permitted me to browse his vast collection on the condition that anything learned not be used for evil. With my canteen half empty, my time is limited and I am in two minds about what I should research.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWSTLIBRARY.1;Knowledge for Knowledge's Sake;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWSTLIBRARY.3;I spent the few days I had researching weapons, enemy weaknesses, and military strategy. When questioned by a suspicious Wan Shi Tong, I answered that I am writing a historical fiction novel and wanted to get the details right. After a snide remark on my intelligence, he continued on his way. I completed my research and left the library with just enough water to return to civilisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWSTLIBRARY.3;Bright enough to fool you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWSTLIBRARY.5;I spent the few days I had researching weapons, enemy weaknesses, and military strategy. I asked one of the Knowledge Seekers where I might find a topological map of the enemy's capital, letting slip that it would be useful during a siege. To my horror, I found a furious Wan Shi Tong standing behind me. He accused me of betraying his trust, and intending to misuse knowledge for evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWSTLIBRARY.5;Please, I'm desperate to protect the people I love!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
