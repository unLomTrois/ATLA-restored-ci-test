EVTNAME_ATLA_RIP_10001;Comet's Wake;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_10001;Months since the Comet shot through the skies, the wind has carried the ashes of everything destroyed by the Fire Nation's ruthless campaign of destruction. Dark clouds have blanketed some corners of the earth, bringing famine. Now, reports are coming in of a sickness spreading amongst those exposed to the ash. Clearly, a crisis is developing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4501;Our factories are home to many dedicated craftsmen as well as military engineers, and one such man as caught his superior's attention as a highly talented engineer. Perhaps his talents could better serve us directly?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4501;Yes, he could be of use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4501;We have no need of some overqualified worker.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4514;The Agricultural Plant we built has allowed us to amass a considerable stockpile of preserved foodstuffs. As harvests turn poor however, many in the province starve. Our advisors are wondering if we should distribute some of the stockpile to ease the burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4514;Of course we will.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4514;Of course we will, for a price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4512;A report is coming in that workers for our factory in the [hospital_location.GetName] province are protesting for better conditions after too many of their fellow workers have become maimed or killed by machinery incidents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4512;We'll make sure the factory is made safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4512;Send the troops in to put them back to work!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4504;Recently, villages have begun to loudly protest the presence of a factory in their province, [hospital_location.GetName]. They are saying that the waste from the factory has ruined their water and poisoned their land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4504;We'll compensate them and put an end to this waste problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4504;Bah, the factory is worth more than a few thousand peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4505;After rejecting a petition to clean up our factories sometime ago, landowners have taken to sabotaging our factories in the [hospital_location.GetName] province. Advisors are split whether we should fix the problem or whether we should crush this act of rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4505;We'll put an end to this issue then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4505;Send in the army and put these rebels down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4520;Recently, at our factory in the [hospital_location.GetName] province, a chemical vat as exploded, seriously injuring numerous workers and shutting down the plant. It will take some cost to repair, but workers are clamouring for compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4520;We'll will pay workers and their families what they are owed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ATLA_RIP_4520;We'll only pay for repairs, the workers knew the risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

colony_1_desc;This province is in the early stages of colonisation, with a few colonists arriving from the homeland as occupying forces still clash with local resistance. As the colony prospers, it will grow in size.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
colony_2_desc;This province is undergoing rapid colonisation, with more colonists flowing in to join those already well settled. There is still a great deal of resistance from the original populace. As the colony prospers, it will grow in size.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
colony_3_desc;This province is the advanced stages of colonisation, with colonists well settled into their new homes, and the local populace either being integrated or dispersed. As the colony prospers, it will grow in size.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLADESC.9002;We are getting good news, our colony in [From.GetName] is growing by the day. As it does, our grip on the region grows tighter and more of our people are willing to migrate, steadily increasing the colony's population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLADESC.9003;Reports suggest that our colony in [From.GetName] is prospering, bringing in more and more colonists seeking wealth and land. If this keeps up at the current rate, soon our people will outnumber the native [From.Culture.GetName] population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLADESC.9004;Devastating news is coming in that our colony in [From.GetName] has been destroyed. The surviving colonists have packed up and returned to our homeland, abandoning their efforts to settle there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLADESC.9005;News has come in that our colony in the [From.GetName] province has been severely damaged. With many colonists dead, this will set our efforts for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLADESC.9006;After many years of toil, our colonists have made the [From.GetName] province their home. As time goes on, they appear to have become intermingled with the native population to a degree, though without a question they are our people and [From.GetName] is no longer a colony, but a prosperous territory in our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLADESC.9007;We have destroyed our enemy's colony in [From.GetName] province, putting an end to their efforts to seize that land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLAOPT.9002;Good news indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLAOPT.9003;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLAOPT.9004;No doubt this will reflect badly on us…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATLAOPT.9005;We'll have to turn the situation around.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ATLAOPT.9007;A fine deed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.107;As surely as the seasons change, the Avatar Cycle continues. With the passing of the previous Avatar, is all but sure now that they will be reborn amongst the nomadic Airbenders. It will be many years until the identity of the Avatar once again becomes known.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.107;The Cycle continues on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAB.107;The emergence of this Avatar may hinder our plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAC.107;The Avatar is amongst us once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.108;As surely as Autumn turns to Winter, the Avatar Cycle continues. With the passing of the previous Avatar, they will now once again be reborn among the Water Tribes. It will be a great many years until either Northern or Southern Tribes discover the identity of this new Avatar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.108;We welcome the Avatar once more to our Tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAB.108;The Avatar Cycle continues...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.109;As surely as Winter turns to Spring, the Avatar Cycle continues. With the previous Avatar gone, it is only a matter of time until they are reborn somewhere in the vast lands and numerous peoples of the Earthbenders. It will no doubt be decades until the Avatar can be found in such a place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.109;Perhaps the Avatar was born somewhere not too far from here...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAB.109;This new Avatar could be anywhere from Ba Sing Se to the Si Wong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.110;As surely as Spring turns to Summer, the Avatar Cycle continues. With the previous Avatar's passing, it is now only a matter of time until the Avatar will once again be reborn amongst the Firebenders. It will no doubt be many years until the Fire Sages can identify this new Avatar...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.110;Hopefully the wisdom of the Fire Sages find them quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
