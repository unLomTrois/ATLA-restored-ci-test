EVTDESCbending.94;After years of trying, I still can't bend at all! I don't understand why I can't when everyone else can.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.95;Today, [From.GetFirstName] came and asked you when they will start bending like you. As time wears on, it's becoming increasingly apparent [From.GetSheHe] never will.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.95;Maybe you're a late bloomer.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.95;It's common that some never learn...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.96;My [GetFromRelation] says that I still might bend one day.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.96;Obviously [From.GetSheHe] is just trying to make me feel better.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.97;My [GetFromRelation] says that some people never bend...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.97;I wanted too though...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.98;It appears [From.GetFirstName] has finally begun to Airbend, eager to make a mess of things and to start learning how to play air ball.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.99;[From.GetFirstName] came to you today and created a gust of wind that almost swept you off your feet.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.98;[From.GetSheHe] will be very happy.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.98;[From.GetFirstName] is an Airbender.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.100;After spending weeks training with the Healers, I was able to use my Waterbending to heal others!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.100;I'm a healer now!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.101;[From.GetFirstName] has been spending a great deal of time with the Healers, and now, [From.GetSheHe] too has learned how mend wounds with Waterbending.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.101;I'm proud.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.101;[From.GetFirstName] has done well.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbending.101;Healing's not a warrior's duty.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.102;One day, after being scolded, you feel so angry you could literally explode. Shouting in rage, you do.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.102;Wow! Look what I can do!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.103;You hear an explosion outside. Rushing out, you find [From.GetFirstName] lying wounded in a smouldering crater. After rushing to treat their injuries, you learn [From.GetFirstName] caused this catastrophe with some kind of bending.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.103;This ability is much too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.104;You hear an explosion outside. Rushing out, you find [From.GetFirstName] creating these explosions with some kind of Firebending as [From.GetSheHe] happily blasting apart everything in sight.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.104;What an extraordinary ability! Please stop!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.105;I've risen early every morning, listened closely to my instructors and practised whenever allowed. Bending comes naturally to me and I'm already more advanced than some adults.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.105;They'll be so proud of me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.106;[From.GetFirstName] recently showed off their bending, impressing everyone. It's clear [From.GetSheHe] is extraordinarily talented and a born natural.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.106;[From.GetSheHeCap] makes me proud.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.106;[From.GetSheHeCap] did well, but there are more important things than bending.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.162;I'm nearing the end of my training, but I still think there's more out there for me to learn about Bending. Perhaps I could ask for help?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingA.162;I'm sure my parents can help!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingB.162;Maybe my parents could find someone to help me.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingC.162;Nah, I won't bother.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.163;Recently, [From.GetFirstName] came and asked me to complete [From.GetHerHis] training. [From.GetFirstName] is almost an adult and believes [From.GetSheHe] is ready to learn anything left we have to teach.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingA.163;I have nothing left to teach you, child.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingB.163;I'm sure there's a few more things you could learn.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingC.163;Well, perhaps there is one technique I could teach you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingD.163;I'm too busy right now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.164;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to teach me a special technique! I feel I'm so much better at Bending now because of it!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.164;Much better.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.165;Recently, [From.GetFirstName] came and told you that [From.GetSheHe] feels [From.GetSheHe] isn't as good a Bender as [From.GetSheHe] should be and asked if you'd be willing to pay for an instructor so [From.GetSheHe] can improve.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingA.165;I'll pay then.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingB.165;I'll do no such thing.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.1;This morning I found the tea I had drank the night before on the kitchen table. When I took a sip of it, it was boiling hot!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.1;I'm a firebender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.1;It must have been someone else's tea..;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.2;My [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] boiled tea with firebending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.2;Kids say the darnedest things;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.2;A firebender just like me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.2;My [GetFromRelation] is a firebender;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.3;[From.GetFirstName] says I'm not really a bender after all.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.3;That's too bad;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.4;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to try warming some tea again and it worked!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.4;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] is proud of me. I can't wait to learn more!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.5;I'm excited to start bending, but there's so much I don't know about it yet!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPAbending.5;I should ask somone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.6;Today [From.GetFirstName] started asking me lots of questions about firebending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.6;I'll tell you when you are older.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.6;Where do I start?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.7;Today [From.GetFirstName] spent the day telling me about the finer points of firebending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.7;I've learned so much.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.8;[From.GetFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] would answer my questions about bending when I'm older.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.8;But I'm old enough;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.9;My friends say that our ancestors have been firebenders for hundreds of years, but where did it come from?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.9;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPbending.9;You will ask the appropriate adult;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.10;[From.GetFirstName] has been to curious about firebending recently. Today [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I know its origins.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.10;Firebending originates from our ancestors eating all their vegetables.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.10;Let me tell you about the dragons!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.10;It was the sun? Or was it the turtleducks?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.11;[From.GetFirstName] sat me down and told me all about dragons today.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.11;When I grow up I want to firebend just as good as the dragons can!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.12;[From.GetFirstName] told me that our ancestors became firebenders from eating their vegetables.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.12;I hate vegetables!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.13;When I asked [From.GetFirstName] about where firebending originates [From.GetSheHe]seemed very confused;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.13;It's a mystery after all!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.14;I've learned a lot since I discovered I'm a firebender, but it feels like there's still so much to discover. /n I should ask someone  about attending firebending school or maybe my very own private tutor?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.14;I really hope I'm good enough!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.15;[From.GetFirstName] thinks it's about time [From.GetSheHe] attends a firebending academy to expand [From.GetHerHis] firebending skills.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.15;I'm all the education [From.GetSheHe] need!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.15;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.16;[From.GetFirstName] told me I can't attend the local firebending academy. I begged to [From.GetHerHim] over and over but nothing changed [From.GetHerHis] mind at all.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.16;[From.GetSheHe] is just jealous of my talent.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.17;[From.GetFirstName] says I can start school next week. I can't wait to learn more about firebending!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.18;The streets at [Root.Location.GetName] are buzzing with people and shopkeepers. Some street hustlers have attracted a crowd. They have incorporated fireferrets in their acrobatic show. One of the fire ferrets look scared with a collar on.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.18;I shall free the fire ferret!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.18;Not worth the risk;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.19;As I walked in [Root.Capital.GetName] today, I saw the cutest little fire ferret in the pet shop window.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.19;I just have to have it!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.19;I do not have any money on me though;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.31;I was eating some delicious seaweed soup, when suddenly the liquid in my bowl splashed everywhere.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.31;Did I just waterbend?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.31;I'm so clumsy!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.32;Today [From.GetFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] waterbent [From.GetHerHis] soup.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.32;My [GetFromRelation] is a waterbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.32;A waterbender just like me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.32;You made a huge mess!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.33;[From.GetFirstName] scolded me and told me to clean up the mess I made.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.33;It was an accident!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.34;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to try bending some water again and it worked!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.34;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] is proud of me. I can't wait to learn more!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBending.35;I'm excited to start bending but there's so much I don't know about it yet.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.35;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCbending.39;The elders of [Root.Capital.GetName] says that our ancestors have been waterbenders for hundreds of years, but where did it come from?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.39;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.40;[From.GetFirstName] has been so curious about waterbending recently. Today [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I know its origins.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.40;Waterbending is just an advanced form of tearbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.40;Let me tell you about the moon!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.40;It was the ocean! Wait, that is not right!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.41;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] sat me down today and told me all about the moon.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.41;The moon is so pretty. I wish I could marry it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.42;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] told me that waterbending is just an advanced form of tearbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.42;I'm not a cry baby!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.43;When I asked [From.GetFirstName] about where waterbending came from [From.GetSheHe] seemed very confused.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.43;It's a mystery after all!;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTEbending.47;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.48;Carrying my things around can be so much work at times. If I had a trusty buffaloyak, things sure would be easier.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.48;I'll just have to buy one.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.48;But I can't afford one.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.61;I was so mad at my parent for taking my toys from me. When I stomped my foot in anger the entire house shook!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.61;I must be an earthbender;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.61;Oh no, an earthquake!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.62;I was putting away [From.GetFirstName]'s toys when suddenly the house shook. [From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] did it by stomping [From.GetHerHis] feet.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.62;My [GetFromRelation] is an earthbender;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.62;An earthbender just like me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.62;I'll have to explain to [From.GetFirstName] what an earthquake is.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.63;[From.GetFirstName] says I'm not really an earthbender after all.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.63;That's too bad...;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCbending.69;My friends tell me that our ancestors have been earthbenders since Oma and Shu, but who did they learn it from?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.69;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.70;[From.GetFirstName] has been so curious about earthbending recently. Today [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I know who taught Oma and Shu.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.70;It was love that taught them.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.70;It was the badgermoles of course!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.70;The secret tunnel taught them... or was it a platypusbear?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.71;[From.GetFirstName] sat me down and told me all about how the badgermoles taught Oma and Shu today.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.71;Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Though the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret, secret, tunnel! Yeah!;;;;;;;;;,,,,,
EVTDESCbending.72;[From.GetFirstName] told me that Oma and Shu learned earthbending through true love.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.72;Gross, I don't want cooties!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.73;When I asked [From.GetFirstName] about who taught Oma and Shu earthbending [From.GetSheHe] seemed very confused.;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCbending.78;Today I was passing by the stables when the most gorgeous ostrichhorse caught my eye.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.78;Money is no object;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.78;Money is an object. I don't have any to spare.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.91;Today I sneezed and suddenly went flying high into the sky;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.91;I am an airbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.92;An airbending master has taken a lot of interest in my airbending skill;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.92;He will teach me well.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.93;Since I can remember I've dreamed of riding my own skybison with the earth beneath me and the sky above me. The day has finally come for me to get my own skybison. But how will I know which one to choose?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.93;Eww, this one licked me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.20;For several months I've risen with the sun and settled with it. Most of my waken hours I've trained and drilled my firebending. Learning advanced techniques and mastering breathing have finally improved my proficiency.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.20;This can only be good!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.21;Despite my initial enthusiasm to train with the best firebender around, I found it more fun to play ball and wreck havoc with a new friend.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.21;I should work harder I guess..;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.21;This is more fun!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.22;The firebending academy my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is training at has asked to for a new donation, otherwise it might close.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.22;Anything for a worthy cause.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.22;You are asking for too much!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.23;My [GetFromRelation] has worked hard to improve [From.GetHerHis] bending proficiency.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.23;I'm so proud!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.24;Even though I've given a generous 'donation' to the firebending academy, my [GetFromRelation] has been skulking from training and hasn't improved at all.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.24;That is too bad...;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCbendingA.152;Today, Avatar [From.GetFirstName] arrived as part of [From.GetHerHis] quest to master the four elements. [From.GetSheHeCap] believes you are capable master Earthbender, and has asked you to to instruct them in Earthbending.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAbending.152;I'd be honoured.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.152;I'm afraid it would be beyond my ability.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTbending.171;[From.GetFirstName] has the makings of a great Avatar.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTbending.172;[From.GetSheHeCap] probably won't even need me soon.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.173;They'll shape up eventually.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.173;They'll never understand it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.174;They simply don't know their own strength.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.174;The Avatar clearly wields power they cannot handle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTbending.175;It has been an honour.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTbending.176;I wish them luck. They'll need it.;;;;;;;;;x
