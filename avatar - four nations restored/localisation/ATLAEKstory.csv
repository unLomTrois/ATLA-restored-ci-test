EVTTITEKSTORY1;Conquest by Words or Swords?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY1;Since the assassination of Earth King Yi Ming, confidence in the Badgermole Throne has plummeted, and our unruly vassals have stopped paying tribute. With the collapse of the entire Kingdom on the horizon, we must now decide how we're going to commence the re-unification of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekreconquestcanon;Our military might will crush all opposition!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekunitybywords;There has been enough suffering, the time has come for diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY2;Rise and Fall;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY2;Tired of the chaos brought about by the fall of Chin, most of the renegade lords are easily swayed to kow-tow before you. However, a few upstarts are still fiercely loyal to the fallen conqueror, and some even believe they might become the next great warlord.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekstory2a;Garrison their borders. They only understand might.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekpeacemart1;Your military flex proved successful, as the upstarts quickly surrendered once your troops reached their cities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekpeacemart2;Still fanatically loyal to Chin, the upstarts hold strong against your display of military might.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekstory2b;Let us speak with them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekpeace1diplo1;It turns out, most of Chin's fanatic followers are simple lords suffering from delusions of grandeur. After a small time negotiating with each, they come to realise the reality of their situation, and quietly rejoin the fold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekpeace1diplo2;Chin's followers are little more than barbarians -- your peaceful approach proved meaningless to them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekstory3b;Increase their taxes!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekpeace1tariffs1;Unable to withstand your bureaucratic assault, the rogue lords find themselves forced to submit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekpeace1tariffs2;The upstart lords refuse to pay your 'ludicrous' new taxes, now seemingly spending their money preparing for war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekstory3c;Ask the Avatar for help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
summon_avatar_chin;The Avatar will consider your offer..;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY3;Gathering Storm;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY3;With the remaining lords loyal to Chin beginning to fall into line, the re-unification of the Earth Kingdom has been progressing smoothly. However, not everything is quiet in the city, and rumours reach your throne that the peasants of the Lower Ring are fed up with your land-grabbing -- they think you can more about the outer reaches of the Kingdom than you do Ba Sing Se itself! Before this becomes a full-blown civil war, these soon-to-be rebels must be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;x
iwilldealwiththemmyself;These are my subjects! I will deal with them myself!;;;;;;;;;;;x
rebelion_continues;Rebellion Continues...;;;;;;;;;;;x
summontheavatar;Summon the Avatar to deal with them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY4;Peace at Last!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY4a;Your silver-tongue has helped avoid any bloodshed, and you graciously welcome the final renegade lords back into your domain. For the first time since the assassination of Yi Ming, the Earth Kingdom stands united!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY4b;Unable to function from your brutal tariffs, the remnants of Chin reluctantly bend the knee, desperate for financial relief. For the first time since the assassination of Yi Ming, the Earth Kingdom stands united!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY4c;Respecting your raw military might, you welcome the last of Chin's loyalists back into your ranks. For the first time since the assassination of Yi Ming, the Earth Kingdom stands united!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY4d;Not wanting to risk the wrath of the Avatar, the rebelling lords agree to rejoin the Kingdom, without any bloodshed. For the first time since the assassination of Yi Ming, the Earth Kingdom stands united!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITEKSTORY6;Chin Remnants Rally;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY6;Not being beaten so easily, the remnants of Chin's Empire begin mustering their forces to fight you! With no other choice, you must meet the traitor lords in the field of battle!;;;;;;;;;;;x
chinitstreasonthen;It's treason, then..;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY7;Summons from Ba Sing Se;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY7;The Earth King has summoned you to Ba Sing Se, requesting your help in dealing with the lingering remnants of Chin's Empire. Although deceased, several lords still proclaim absolute loyalty to Chin, and a handful even think they may usurp what the great warlord left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;x
avatar_yes_chin;I will accept his summons!;;;;;;;;;;;x
avatar_no_chin;The Earth King should deal with them himself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY8;The Avatar Defies You!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY8;The Avatar refuses to help, saying it would be a grievous misuse of her power to fight civilians. This defiance cannot go unanswered!;;;;;;;;;;;x
kyoshiarrestcanon;GUARDS ARREST HER!;;;;;;;;;;;x
youactivatedmuhtrapcard;Poison her dinner tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
heccyouiwilldealwiththemyself;We don't need her anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY10;Clear Verdant Sky;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY10;The peasant rebellion has been crushed, and peace has returned to the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. With the capital firmly under your control, your reconquest of the once-vassals can proceed uninterrupted.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fullyoperationalbattlestation;My Kingdom is once again fully operational!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY11;Our bumbling administration is stoking the flames of rebellion among the peasantry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKSTORYEVT11OPT;We're better than this..;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY12;War and corruption are no strangers, and your bureaucrats have deduced that several of your tax collectors have been skimming off the top. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKSTORYEVT12OPT;Punish those responsible!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY13;Rebellion has weakened your government, and damaged otherwise delicate supply lines. Because of this, some of your ministries have been unable to meet their yearly quotas, resulting in famine and disease in the Middle and Upper rings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKSTORYEVT13OPT;Fire those incompetent enough to let this happen!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY14;Amid the chaos of the rebellion, a new "Earth King" has arisen, declaring themselves the true claimant of the Badgermole Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKSTORYEVT14OPT;Only I possess the divine right to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY15;Seeing merit in the unification of the Earth Kingdom, the Avatar has agreed to join your negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;x
avataracceptspeace;They will prove a powerful influence.;;;;;;;;;;;x
chin_submit_avatar;Not willing to put their lives on the line against the Avatar, the remaining lords kneel before you, utterly submitting to you rule.;;;;;;;;;;;x
chin_war_avatar;It seems not even the influence of the Avatar is able to rally the remaining lords to your side. You have no choice, but to prepare for war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY16;The Avatar has rejected our pleas, saying that they are meant to maintain the balance of the world, not trifle with petty politics.;;;;;;;;;;;x
avatarrefusepeace;Rally the troops! We will show our might!;;;;;;;;;;;x
chin_avatar_war;Then there's no choice but war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY17;Mandate of Spirits or People?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY17;The Badgermole Throne has a way of perverting all those who sit on it -- even the most virtuous ruler can fall prey to tyranny, given the taste of power. You wonder, perhaps, if the best thing you could do for the Kingdom is ensure future kings rule on a leash, unable to commit atrocities such as those seen during Chin's campaign of terror.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekbecameconstitution;I will ask members of Royal Court to help me draft a Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;x
unlimitedpower;Only those born to royalty are fit to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY18;Formation of Dai Li;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY18;Against your will, the Avatar has established the Dai Li, a sacred order to watch over the Earth Kingdom, and to protect the cultural heritage of Ba Sing Se. However, you know the truth -- these Dai Li exist to keep you in check, to end your glorious campaign of re-conquest. With eyes watching from every shadow, you have become a prisoner in your own Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
damnit;I am surrounded!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY19;Avatar's Demands;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY19;With your back against the wall, you submit to the Avatar's demands to abdicate your absolute power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
canonending;It is the end? Have I lost..?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY20;Dai Li;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY20;Recently, one of your advisors has floated the idea of creating a secret police force, able to catch traitors and act as an elite bending unit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dailiyes;We shall have eyes all over Ba Sing Se!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dailino;Sounds a bit tyrannical.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITEKSTORY21;Constitution of Earth Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEKSTORY21;The Earth Kingdom has become a Constitutional Monarchy, now abiding by a document signed by the reigning monarch and all factions leaders. In this agreement, the Earth King has relinquished some of their power to the Royal Court, thereby allowing their vassal subjects to run with more autonomy. This development is an extraordinary one, and will surely shape history for years to come!;;;;;;;;;;;x
peacefulending;This Constitution will unite our people for eternity!;;;;;;;;;;;x
peacefulendingekingdom;The tyranny of the Earth Monarchs has ended!;;;;;;;;;;;x
peacefulendingrest;Consti-what?;;;;;;;;;;;x
